# Predicting-Chronic-Kidney-Disease-Machine-Learning

The objective of this project is to use some preliminary patient information to predict Chronic Kidney Disease in its early phases. 
Chronic kidney disease, commonly known as chronic kidney failure, is a condition in which the kidneys gradually lose function. 
Wastes and surplus fluids are filtered from your blood and expelled as urine by your kidneys.
When chronic kidney disease progresses, your body might accumulate harmful quantities of fluid, electrolytes, and wastes.
You may have few indications or symptoms in the early stages of chronic renal disease. Chronic renal disease may not be seen until your kidney function has deteriorated severely. 
Chronic kidney disease treatment focuses on delaying the course of kidney damage, which is usually accomplished by addressing the underlying cause. 
Without mechanical filtering (dialysis) or a kidney transplant, chronic kidney disease can proceed to end-stage kidney failure, which is fatal


1.	**Numpy**: It is the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. Numpy aims to provide an array object that is up to 50x faster than traditional Python lists.
2.	**Pandas**: The Pandas library provides high-performance and easy-to-use data structures. We used the pandas library to import the dataset in our data frame and the same was used in all the steps.
3.	**Matplotlib**: Matplotlib is a visualization library in Python for 2D plots of arrays. One of the greatest benefits of visualization is that it allows us visual access to huge amounts of data in easily digestible visuals. Matplotlib consists of several plots like line, bar, scatter plot, histogram etc.
4.	**Seaborn**: Seaborn is a Python data visualization library based on matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics
5.	**Plotly.express**: Plotly Express is a new high-level Python visualization library. Itâ€™s a wrapper for Plotly.py that exposes a simple syntax for complex charts and comes with on-board datasets, color scales and themes.
6.	**SciKit Learn**: This is the primary library being used in the project for applying the classification models/families as well as implementing the preprocessing and cross-validation steps.
