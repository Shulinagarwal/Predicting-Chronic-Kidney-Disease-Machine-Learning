# Predicting-Chronic-Kidney-Disease-Machine-Learning

The objective of this project is to use some preliminary patient information to predict Chronic Kidney Disease in its early phases. 
Chronic kidney disease, commonly known as chronic kidney failure, is a condition in which the kidneys gradually lose function. 
Wastes and surplus fluids are filtered from your blood and expelled as urine by your kidneys.
When chronic kidney disease progresses, your body might accumulate harmful quantities of fluid, electrolytes, and wastes.
You may have few indications or symptoms in the early stages of chronic renal disease. Chronic renal disease may not be seen until your kidney function has deteriorated severely. 
Chronic kidney disease treatment focuses on delaying the course of kidney damage, which is usually accomplished by addressing the underlying cause. 
Without mechanical filtering (dialysis) or a kidney transplant, chronic kidney disease can proceed to end-stage kidney failure, which is fatal
